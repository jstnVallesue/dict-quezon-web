        <b>SUBJECT: PRESCRIBING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE ACCREDITATION OF GOVERNMENT REGISTRATION AUTHORITIES UNDER THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION SCHEME FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURES</b><br><br>
        <p>Pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order No. 810 issued on 15 June 2009 and entitled, “Institutionalizing the Certification Scheme for Digital Signatures and Directing the Application of Digital Signatures in E-Government Services,” this Memorandum Circular is hereby prescribed by the National Computer Center (NCC), in its capacity as Government Certification Authority (GovCA), for the compliance, information, and guidance of all concerned:</p>
        <br><b>Section I OBJECTIVES</b><br><br>
        <p>This Memorandum Circular prescribes the POLICIES AND PROCEDURES governing the accreditation of government agencies as Government Registration Authorities (GovRAs) under the National Certification Scheme for Digital Signatures as mandated under Executive Order No. 810, Series of 2009.</p>
        <br><b>Section II DEFINITION OF TERMS</b><br><br>
        <ol>
          <li><p><b>Accreditation and Assessment Body</b> – refers to the body that accredits the Certification Authorities (CAs) and conducts regular assessment of such CAs to ensure compliance to prescribed criteria, guidelines and standards; refers to the Philippine Accreditation Office (PAO), under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Certificate</b> – an electronic document issued to support a digital signature, which purports to confirm the identity or other significant characteristics of the person who holds a particular key pair. Certificates issued may be for general use or for specific use only;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>General Certificate</b> – a certificate which can be used for all government and private transactions;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Specific Purpose Certificate</b> – a certificate which can only be used for a specific purpose;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Certificate Revocation LiGovernment Registration Authority (GovRA)st (CRL)</b> – a time-stamped list that identifies/ contains revoked or invalid certificates. The CRL is signed by a Certification Authority and is published periodically in a public repository;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Certification Authority (CA)</b> – issues digitally-signed public key certificates and attests that the public key embedded in the certificate belongs to the particular subscriber as stated in the certificate. A CA may be involved in a number of administrative tasks such as end-user registration, although these tasks are often delegated to the Registration Authority (RA). The CA may either be a government body or private entity;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Digital Signature</b> – refers to an electronic signature consisting of a transformation of an electronic document of an electronic data message using an asymmetric or public cryptosystem, such that a person having the initial untransformed document and the signer’s public key can accurately determine: (i) whether the transformation was created using the private key that corresponds to the signer’s public key; and (ii) whether the initial digital document had been altered after the transformation was made;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Government Certification Authority (GovCA)</b> – refers to the government body that issues digitally-signed public key certificates and attests that the public key embedded in the certificate belongs to the particular subscriber as stated in the certificate. The GovCA designates Government Registration Authorities (GovRAs) and conducts regular assessment of such GovRAs to ensure compliance to prescribed criteria, guidelines and standards. The GovCA is part of ICTO;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Government Registration Authority (GovRA)</b> – refers to a government agency designated by the Certification Authority (CA) to perform administrative tasks such as end-user registration;</p></li>
        </ol><br>
        <ol>
          <li><p><b>Root Certification Authority (Root CA)</b> – issues and manages certificates to government and private CAs; the Root CA is part of ICTO;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Subscriber</b> – an individual or entity applying for and using digital certificates issued by the CA;</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Personal Information Controller</b> – means a person or organization who controls the collection, holding, processing or use of personal information. It includes a person or organization who instructs another person or organization to collect, hold, process, use, transfer, or disclose personal information on his or her behalf, but excludes a person or organization who performs such functions as instructed by another person or organization. It also excludes an individual who collects, holds, processes or uses personal information in connection with the individual’s personal, family or household affairs.</p></li>
